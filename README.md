# Beauty-products-and-sentiment-analysis

## About the project
This project focuses on uncovering trends in customer engagement, sentiment analysis and pricing in the beauty industry.

## Datasets
The datasets were collected via Python scraper in 2023, which I found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nadyinky/sephora-products-and-skincare-reviews). It contains over 8,000 products and over 1 million reviews from the Sephora website.
