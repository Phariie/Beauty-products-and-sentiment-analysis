# Beauty-products-and-sentiment-analysis

## About the project
This project focuses on uncovering trends in customer engagement, sentiment analysis and pricing in the beauty industry.

## Datasets
The datasets were collected via Python scraper in 2023, which I found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nadyinky/sephora-products-and-skincare-reviews). It contains over 8,000 products and over 1 million reviews from the Sephora website.

## Setting Hypothesis and goals
- Hypothesis "Mid-priced personal care products receive a higher volume of reviews compared to premium or budget-priced alternatives, driven by a perceived balance between affordability and quality."

  Highest potential products
  Most suitable price range
  Strategies to maximize customer engagments
  
## Approach for data analysis
